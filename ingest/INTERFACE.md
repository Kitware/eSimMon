# Proposed Static Site Interface
The basic idea here is to provide a simple hierarchy of JSON files that mimick a RESTful API. These can be used to monitor a number of runs and the variables assocated with the runs. By breaking things down into a hierarchy the idea is that any of the individual files shouldn't get too large, so they can be fetched and parsed quickly within a polling loop.

` /shots/index.json` - The list of runs to monitor. The file will contain a list of objects contain the following properties:

- `shot_name` - Can be the same for multiple job submissions because it could be restarted during the next day, etc.
- `run_name`
- `username`
- `date`
- `machine_name` - could be summit, titan, â€¦

For example:

```json
[{
    "shot_name": "myShot",
    "run_name": "myRun",
    "username": "cjh1",
    "machine_name": "titan",
    "date": "2019-05-16T15:54:35+0000"
}]
```

This is for a project. If we have multiple projects, then we need multiple dashboards; i.e. a dashboard per project.


`/shots/<shot_number>/<run_number>/time.json` - The current timestep associated with this run. This would be monitored to determine when a new timestep is available for this run. The `complete` flag is used to indicate that the simulation is complete. Note that the current timestep should be incremented after all the files associated with the timestep have been written.

**TODO: Where do we get `shot_number` and `run_number` from? Should they be included in `/shots/index.json`?**

```json
{
    "current": 1,
    "complete": false
}
```

`/shots/<shot_number>/<run_number>/<physical_time>/variables.json` - The list of variables associated with the run.

```json
[{
    "group_name": "myGroup",
    "variable_name": "myVar",
    "image_name": "path/in/archive/myVarImage.png"
}]
```

`/shots/<shot_number>/<run_number>/<physical_time>/images.tar.gz` - The archive containing the image for the timestep.


**TODO: What about metadata from the variables?**
